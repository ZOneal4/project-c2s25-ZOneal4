Prototype for Semester project.
Title of the game is "Baseball Manager Tycoon". 
The object of the game is to pick a team and simulate a 60 game season
in hopes of creating a Baseball dynasty. I plan to add many different features
(Player Attributes, Team Chemistry, Trading) that will make your road to a baseball dynasty fun and compelling.
So far, the only problem I am having is getting the season simulation to give an accurate W-L total,
as of now the total are coming out to be 0-0 for all teams.
